# This repository has implemented a project to determine the topic of a news story based on its content using machine learning methods

## The project consists of the following stages:
- Scraping data from a news portal
- Primary data analysis
- Solution of the classification problem
- Creating a chat bot and adding a trained model to it

## Description of files:
- `parsing_ria_novosty` in the notebooks folder scrapes data from the RIA Novosti portal
- `EDA` in the notebooks folder carries out primary processing of the received data
- `topics_classiification` in the notebooks folder solves the classification problem using the Word2Vec algorithm and logistic regression
